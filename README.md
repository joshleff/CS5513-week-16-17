# Final Hybrid Mobile App

In this assignment,
I extended the **Ionic** app.
I used **Advanced Custom Fields** and **ACF to Custom Database Tables**
plugins to create new post types and database tables
on my **Pantheon** hosted **Wordpress** site.
I edited the **PHP** functions file with custom **SQL** queries to return
**JSON** data at new **REST** endpoint urls. 
That data was then rendered inside the **Ionic** app.
I then created a **Google Android** apk and tested it successfully on **Android Studio**.
